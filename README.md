#Team player Attitude

I would have divide the work between frontend and backend in a mutual agreedment and we would be in continuous contact with each other to help us to have a more efficient workflow.

#If i had more time

1. Add a database (such as MongoDB).
2. Run "npm run build" to create the /dist folder and join the frontend and backend
3. Implement a responsive design.n
4. Improve the application by adding photos of the superheroes, allowing the addition of different powers, and the option to specify if they have an alias or not.

Additionally, depending on how we want to grow the application, we could add more complex features like authentication, authorization, and real-time WebSockets.
